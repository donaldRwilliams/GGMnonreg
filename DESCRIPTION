Description: This package uses non-regularized methods to estimate partial correlation matrices. 
  The current methods consist of multiple regression with AIC or BIC model selection, a non-parameteric 
  bootstrap approach to directly estimate the precision matrix, and Fisher z transformed partial correlations.
