# GGMnonreg

 
[![CircleCI build status](https://circleci.com/gh/donaldRwilliams/GGMnonreg.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/donaldRwilliams/GGMnonreg)


The goal of **GGMnonreg** is to estimate non-regularized Gaussian graphical models. Note that 
the title is a bit of a misnomer, in that Ising and mixed graphical models are also supported.

Graphical modeling is quite common in fields with *wide* data, that is, when there are more 
variables than observations. Accordingly, many regularization-based approaches have been developed for those kinds of data.

More recently, graphical modeling has emerged in psychology [@Epskamp2018ggm], where the data 
is typically long or low-dimensional [*p* < *n*; @williams2019nonregularized; @williams_rethinking]. The primary purpose of  **GGMnonreg** is to provide methods specifically for low-dimensional data 
(e.g., those common to psychopathology networks).

## Supported Models
* Gaussian graphical model. The following data types are supported.
  + Gaussian 
  + Ordinal
  + Binary
* Ising model [@marsman_2018]
* Mixed graphical model

## Additional methods
The following are also included

* Expected network replicability [@williams2020learning]
* Compare Gaussian graphical models
* Measure of parameter uncertainty [@williams2019nonregularized]
* Edge inclusion "probabilities"
* Network visualization with **ggplot2** [@ggplotpackage]
* Constrained precision matrix (the network, given an assumed graph)
* Predictability (variance explained)

## Installation
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldRwilliams/GGMnonreg")
```
