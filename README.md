# GGMnonreg

[![CircleCI build
status](https://circleci.com/gh/donaldRwilliams/GGMnonreg.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/donaldRwilliams/GGMnonreg)

The goal of **GGMnonreg** is to estimate non-regularized Gaussian
graphical models. Note that the title is a bit of a misnomer, in that
Ising and Mixed graphical models are also supported.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldRwilliams/GGMnonreg")
```
